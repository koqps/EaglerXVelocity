Economy: 'Vault'

# If the economy above supports multiple currencies, you can pick a specific currency here.
# If this is not set and the economy has no default currency, UC may pick a random one.
Economy-Currency: ''

# Describes how UC should interact with plugins through the Vault API with regard to
# a player's minimum balance. Available options are:
# - 'delegate': UC will let the economy plugin decide whether a player has enough money to make a purchase.
#     Your economy plugin should do this, so USE 'delegate' UNLESS you're experiencing an issue.
#
# - 'nonnegative': UC will assume that players must have a non-negative balance to make a purchase,
#     but will still check whether the economy plugin returned a success.
#     You may need this if your economy plugin runs async and doesn't immediately
#     know whether a transaction can be performed.
#
# - 'force-nonnegative': UC will assume that players must have a non-negative balance to make a purchase,
#     and will assume success regardless of what the economy plugin returns.
#     You should ONLY use this if your economy plugin responds improperly to UC's requests,
#     for example returning null instead of a response.
